        moment of your life. I want to be there with you to share
        everything that you do every day. I want to be by your side
        when you wake up every morning. I want to kiss your
        forehead every morning when you open your eyes. I want
        to share my coffee with you. I want long and random
        conversations with you all through the day. I want to watch
        you feeling lazy in bed. I want to go on long drives with
        you. I want to dance in the rain with you. I want to sit with
        you under the night sky and watch the stars. I want to sit
        with you and watch sunsets on the beach. I want to cuddle
        with you, snuggle with you and sleep like a baby in your
        arms. I want to be your best friend, I want to be your lover,
        I want to grow old with you. I want to be proud to be called
        yours. I want Happiness and I love you Itsy‚ù§Ô∏èüòòü•π.....!!
